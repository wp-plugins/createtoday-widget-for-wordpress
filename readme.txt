Let users on your site create and buy postcards and greeting cards that use images from your site and get paid for every card created on your site.

== Description ==

The CreateToday Widget (and the WordPress plugin) allows you to monetize the images you have on your site.
Users on your site are given a 'create' button for each image you have, letting them use that image in a new postcard or greeting card.
Once they click the button an overlay with the card creation tools appears in the middle of your page.
Of course, you have the option to enable this widget only for some of the images you have on your site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The create button doesn't show next to my images. What do I do? =

Make sure the images you upload are at least 615 x 870px. The plugin checks the image dimension and won't show the buttons for anything smaller than this.

= In the image properties dialog I see no checkbox to enable/disable the widget for that image. Why? =

That checkbox appears only if the image is larger than 615 x 870px. For anything smaller it won't appear.

= I don't like your default buttons, can I use mine? =

Sure thing. Just set your styles in the advanced settings on the plugin page. For more hands-on changes check out this FAQ on our widget site: http://api.createtoday.com/site/widget/help#help2
